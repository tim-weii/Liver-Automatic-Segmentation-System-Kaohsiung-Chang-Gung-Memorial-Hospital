## üìñ Understanding U-Net and Multi-level U-Net

### üîπ What is U-Net?

U-Net is a **variant of Autoencoder** designed for **image segmentation** tasks.  
It gets its name from its **U-shaped architecture**, consisting of:

- **Encoder (Contracting Path):** Downsampling layers that extract semantic features while reducing spatial resolution.  
- **Decoder (Expanding Path):** Upsampling layers that reconstruct segmentation masks back to input size.  
- **Skip Connections:** Direct links between encoder and decoder layers preserve fine-grained spatial details.  

Without skip connections, small details such as **tumors** would often be lost during feature compression.

### üîπ Why U-Net Works for Medical Imaging

Medical image segmentation requires **pixel-level precision**, often to detect **tiny abnormalities** (e.g., tumors).  
Skip connections allow U-Net to combine **low-level spatial details** (edges, textures) with **high-level semantic context**, making it highly effective for biomedical tasks.

##  Why Multi-level U-Net?

Traditional U-Net has shown strong performance in medical image segmentation,  
but when applied directly to **liver CT scans with tumors**, it encounters several fundamental challenges.  
To overcome these, we designed a **Multi-level U-Net**, where **Stage 1** isolates the liver region and **Stage 2** performs **segment-level + tumor segmentation** inside that ROI.  

---

### üîπ Key Challenges & Motivations

1. **Severe Class Imbalance**  
   - Tumors occupy **<2% of voxels**, while liver/background dominate.  
   - Single U-Net optimizes for global Dice ‚Üí small tumors vanish during downsampling.  
   - Solution: ROI cropping + Focal/Dice Loss to amplify tumor signal.  

2. **Anatomical Complexity**  
   - The liver is divided into **8 Couinaud segments**, each clinically meaningful.  
   - Single U-Net blurs boundaries ‚Üí poor tumor localization.  
   - Solution: Multi-level U-Net outputs **segment-aware tumor mapping**, enabling structured reporting.  

3. **Context Dilution & Efficiency**  
   - Entire abdomen input wastes capacity on irrelevant organs (kidneys, stomach, vessels).  
   - Leads to false positives + slower convergence.  
   - Solution: Stage 1 liver ROI ‚Üí Stage 2 fine segmentation on liver only.

##  Our System Design

1. **Stage 1 ‚Äî Liver ROI Extraction**  
   - First-pass U-Net isolates the **entire liver region** from CT scans.  
   - Provides a **coarse mask** to crop irrelevant organs and reduce search space.  

2. **Stage 2 ‚Äî Multi-level U-Net (Liver Segments + Tumors)**  
   - Input restricted to the **liver ROI from Stage 1**.  
   - Performs **two tasks simultaneously**:  
     - Segmenting liver by **anatomical segments** (lobes/regions).  
     - Segmenting **tumors** within each region.  
   - Tumors are detected **in anatomical context**, improving sensitivity and interpretability.  

3. **Post-processing & Reporting**  
   - Apply 3D connected components, morphological filtering.  
   - Extract **lesion statistics** (size, count, location).  
   - Generate a **structured report** (tumor distribution by liver segment).

##  Benefits of Multi-level U-Net (vs Single U-Net)

| Aspect | Single U-Net (Baseline) | Multi-level U-Net (Our Design) | Benefit |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|---------|
| **Small Tumors** | Vanish due to class imbalance (<2% voxels) | ROI cropping + focal loss enhance tumor-to-background ratio | Better small tumor detection |
| **Boundary Accuracy** | Blurs across liver lobes, hard to localize | Segments **by anatomical regions**, preserving fine boundaries | More precise tumor boundaries |
| **Clinical Interpretability** | Only says ‚Äútumor present‚Äù | Reports **tumor size + segment location (e.g., IVa, 2.3 cm)** | Directly usable in diagnosis |
| **False Positives** | Wasted capacity on irrelevant organs ‚Üí more FP | Ignores kidneys/stomach/etc., focuses on **liver-only ROI** | Fewer false positives |
| **Supervision Signal** | Binary tumor mask only | Multi-task: **segments + tumors** ‚Üí richer gradients | Stronger learning signal |
| **Efficiency & Workflow** | Radiologists must manually verify every CT slice | Structured reports summarize count, size, region ‚Üí quick review | Saves time, reduces fatigue/misdiagnosis |

---

üëâ **Summary:**  
By constraining the model to liver ROI and combining **multi-task supervision (liver + tumors)**, the Multi-level U-Net not only boosts **accuracy** but also aligns outputs with **clinical workflows**, helping radiologists save time and make safer decisions.



##  Workflow (Step-by-Step)

1. **Preprocessing**  
   - Load CT volumes (DICOM/NIfTI).  
   - Apply **HU windowing**, resample to isotropic spacing, normalize.  

2. **Stage 1 ‚Äî Liver Segmentation (U-Net, Level 1)**  
   - Input: preprocessed CT slices.  
   - Output: binary **liver mask**.  
   - Performance: Dice **>0.88**.  

3. **Stage 2 ‚Äî Tumor Segmentation (U-Net, Level 2)**  
   - Input: liver ROI only.  
   - Output: binary **tumor mask**.  
   - Performance: Dice **>0.81**.  

4. **Post-processing**  
   - 3D connected components + morphology.  
   - Compute lesion statistics: **volume, diameter, centroid**.  

5. **Structured Report Generation**  
   - Summarize tumor **count, size, location, stage hints**.  
   - Export **JSON/PDF**. Radiologists can review/edit in Web UI.  

6. **Clinical Review & Database**  
   - Reports + masks stored in **MySQL**.  
   - **Web UI (ReactJS)** supports browsing, editing, export.

##  Challenges

- **Imbalance:** Tumors occupy **<2% of voxels**; na√Øve models ignore them.  
- **Annotation noise:** Radiologists vary; post-processing reduces false lesions.  
- **Two-stage complexity:** Errors from Stage 1 propagate into Stage 2.  

---

##  Clinical Impact

- Radiologists review **AI-assisted structured reports** instead of manual slice-by-slice labeling.  
- **~60% time saved per case** in clinical workflow.  
- Improves consistency, reduces fatigue-related misdiagnosis risk.

##  Future Work

- **Advanced models:** Attention U-Net, TransUNet, Swin-UNet.  
- **Semi-supervised learning:** leverage unlabeled CTs.  
- **Multi-modal fusion:** integrate MRI + CT.  
- **Deployment:** export structured results as **DICOM-SR** for direct PACS integration.
