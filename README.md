##  Liver Anatomy Overview  

The liver is divided into **8 functional segments** (Couinaud‚Äôs classification),  
which are important for **surgical planning and tumor localization**.

- **Right lobe:** Segments 5‚Äì8  
- **Left lobe:** Segments 2‚Äì4  
- **Caudate lobe:** Segment 1  

In clinical practice, radiologists report **tumor size, number, and location** based on these segments.  
This provides critical information for **diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical decisions**.

##  Introduction

Develops a **full-stack liver automatic segmentation system** that combines:

- **Deep Learning (Multi-class U-Net):** For liver and tumor segmentation on CT scans.  
- **Morphological Post-processing:** Connected component analysis, 3D filtering, and noise removal to refine masks.  
- **Flask-based Frontend:** Interactive visualization interface for radiologists.  
- **MySQL Database:** Stores segmentation masks, patient metadata, and structured reports.  

The system is designed for **clinical workflow integration**, enabling radiologists to:  
1. Upload CT scans via the web interface.  
2. Automatically segment the liver and tumors.  
3. Generate a **structured clinical report** with tumor count, size, and segment location.  
4. Review results and validate through an intuitive dashboard.

##  Model Architecture & Results Overview

Before diving into the basics of U-Net, here is a comparison between a **Single U-Net** and our **Multi-class U-Net** pipeline:

To ensure robust training and handle the challenges of **class imbalance** and **overfitting**, I adopted the following strategies:

- **Loss Weighting**  
  - Tumor voxels account for <2% of total volume, leading to severe imbalance.  
  - Applied **class-weighted Dice + Focal Loss**, giving higher penalty to tumor misclassification.  
  - This weighting scheme preserved **small lesion signals** that would otherwise vanish.

- **Early Stopping**  
  - Training monitored on the **validation set** (20% of data).  
  - Stop triggered if no Dice improvement for **20 consecutive epochs**.  
  - Prevents overfitting and accelerates convergence.
  
### Dataset Split
- **Train / Validation / Test = 70% : 20% : 10%**  
- Ensures fair evaluation and prevents overfitting.  
- Reported metrics (Dice scores, miss rates, efficiency gains) are all based on the **independent test set**.

### 1) Single U-Net
- ![Â∞àÈ°å_ÊµÅÁ®ã_page-0012](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/675afab5-ee05-4b42-9220-8afccbead5ad)
- **Architecture:** One encoder‚Äìdecoder network trained to segment both liver and tumors simultaneously.
- **Limitations:**  
  - Tumors occupy <2% of voxels ‚Üí imbalance causes tumors to vanish.  
  - Boundaries between liver segments are blurred, making localization difficult.  
  - Context dilution: model wastes capacity on irrelevant abdominal organs.  

### 2) Multi-class U-Net
![Â∞àÈ°å_ÊµÅÁ®ã_page-0013](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56a2f0e4-b90e-43fa-97a9-7726b0eb8001)

- **Stage 1:** U-Net for liver ROI extraction.  
- **Stage 2:** U-Net for segment-class liver subdivision **+ tumor segmentation** within the ROI.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Higher sensitivity for small tumors.  
  - Better boundary accuracy by segment-aware mapping.  
  - Clinically aligned output (tumor size, count, lobe/segment location).

### What is U-Net?

U-Net is a **variant of Autoencoder** designed for **image segmentation** tasks.  
It gets its name from its **U-shaped architecture**, consisting of:

- **Encoder (Contracting Path):** Downsampling layers that extract semantic features while reducing spatial resolution.  
- **Decoder (Expanding Path):** Upsampling layers that reconstruct segmentation masks back to input size.  
- **Skip Connections:** Direct links between encoder and decoder layers preserve fine-grained spatial details.  

Without skip connections, small details such as **tumors** would often be lost during feature compression.

### Why U-Net Works for Medical Imaging?

Medical image segmentation requires **pixel-level precision**, often to detect **tiny abnormalities** (e.g., tumors).  
Skip connections allow U-Net to combine **low-level spatial details** (edges, textures) with **high-level semantic context**, making it highly effective for biomedical tasks.

##  Why Multi-level U-Net?

Traditional U-Net has shown strong performance in medical image segmentation,  
but when applied directly to **liver CT scans with tumors**, it encounters several fundamental challenges.  
To overcome these, we designed a **Multi-level U-Net**, where **Stage 1** isolates the liver region and **Stage 2** performs **segment-level + tumor segmentation** inside that ROI.  

<p align="center">
  <img width="430" height="418" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8dbc222-ca81-463b-a030-881ccf5e31a4"/>
</p>

##  Our System Design

1. **Stage 1 ‚Äî Liver ROI Extraction**  
   - First-pass U-Net isolates the **entire liver region** from CT scans.  
   - Provides a **coarse mask** to crop irrelevant organs and reduce search space.  

2. **Stage 2 ‚Äî Multi-level U-Net (Liver Segments + Tumors)**  
   - Input restricted to the **liver ROI from Stage 1**.  
   - Performs **two tasks simultaneously**:  
     - Segmenting liver by **anatomical segments** (lobes/regions).  
     - Segmenting **tumors** within each region.  
   - Tumors are detected **in anatomical context**, improving sensitivity and interpretability.  

3. **Post-processing & Reporting**  
   - Apply 3D connected components, morphological filtering.  
   - Extract **lesion statistics** (size, count, location).  
   - Generate a **structured report** (tumor distribution by liver segment).
  
   
###  Key Challenges & Motivations

1. **Severe Class Imbalance**  
   - Tumors occupy **<2% of voxels**, while liver/background dominate.  
   - Single U-Net optimizes for global Dice ‚Üí small tumors vanish during downsampling.  
   - Solution: ROI cropping + Focal/Dice Loss to amplify tumor signal.  

2. **Anatomical Complexity**  
   - The liver is divided into **8 Couinaud segments**, each clinically meaningful.  
   - Single U-Net blurs boundaries ‚Üí poor tumor localization.  
   - Solution: Multi-level U-Net outputs **segment-aware tumor mapping**, enabling structured reporting.  

3. **Context Dilution & Efficiency**  
   - Entire abdomen input wastes capacity on irrelevant organs (kidneys, stomach, vessels).  
   - Leads to false positives + slower convergence.  
   - Solution: Stage 1 liver ROI ‚Üí Stage 2 fine segmentation on liver only.  

---

##  Workflow (Step-by-Step)

1. **Preprocessing**  
   - Load CT volumes (DICOM/NIfTI).  
   - Apply **HU windowing**, resample to isotropic spacing, normalize.  

2. **Stage 1 ‚Äî Liver Segmentation (U-Net, Level 1)**  
   - Input: preprocessed CT slices.  
   - Output: binary **liver mask**.  
   - Performance: Dice **>0.88**.  

3. **Stage 2 ‚Äî Tumor Segmentation (U-Net, Level 2)**  
   - Input: liver ROI only.  
   - Output: binary **tumor mask**.  
   - Performance: Dice **>0.81**.  

4. **Post-processing**  
   - 3D connected components + morphology.  
   - Compute lesion statistics: **volume, diameter, centroid**.  

5. **Structured Report Generation**  
   - Summarize tumor **count, size, location, stage hints**.  
   - Export **JSON/PDF**. Radiologists can review/edit in Web UI.  

6. **Clinical Review & Database**  
   - Reports + masks stored in **MySQL**.  
   - **Web UI (ReactJS)** supports browsing, editing, export.

##  Dataset & Metrics

- **Dataset:** De-identified CT scans from **Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital**, IRB-approved.  
- **Splits:** Train 70% ¬∑ Validation 10% ¬∑ Test 20%  
- **Metrics:** Dice, Hausdorff Distance, Average Surface Distance  

| Task         | Model            | Metric | Result |
|--------------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| Liver Mask   | U-Net (Stage 1) | Dice   | **0.84‚Äì0.91** |
| Tumor Mask   | U-Net (Stage 2) | Dice   | **0.78‚Äì0.85** |
| Report Gen.  | Multi-level Flow | Time saved | **-60% / case** |

---

##  Challenges

- **Imbalance:** Tumors occupy **<2% of voxels**; na√Øve models ignore them.  
- **Annotation noise:** Radiologists vary; post-processing reduces false lesions.  
- **Two-stage complexity:** Errors from Stage 1 propagate into Stage 2.  

---

##  Clinical Impact

- Radiologists review **AI-assisted structured reports** instead of manual slice-by-slice labeling.  
- **~60% time saved per case** in clinical workflow.  
- Improves consistency, reduces fatigue-related misdiagnosis risk.
